UTCS: Modern Web Apps - Fall 2023

No due date


1) What is the difference between a primary key and a foreign key?

2) Consider that we are building an email system in which we want to support a feature where we can attach
   arbitrary tags to emails. An email can have multiple tags and multiple emails can have the same tag.
   For example, consider following three emails with subject and tags.
   Subject               Tags
   Assignment 3          UT, Modern Web apps
   Study group           UT
   Black Friday          Shopping

   Using SQL Alchemy Define tables with appropriate columns to enable following queries:
   - Find all emails corresponding to a specific tag
   - Find all tags for a particular email

3) Using SQLAlchemy write following queries:
   - Insert an email with following subject and tag ("Finals", "UT")
   - Query email subjects that have the tag "UT"

4) Explain with an example what is a SQLAlchemy Session?

5) Explain with an example what is the join operation in SQL 

6) True or False
    a. Auto incrementing column is a good candidate for primary key column
    b. An object that is created but not yet added to a Session is considered to be in 'transient' state
    c. An object that is added to a Session but not yet committed to database is considered to be in 'transient' state.
    d. Given an object's id, we can retrieve the object using either the 'get' method or 'filter_by' filter predicate in SQLAlchemy.
    e. A database transaction/SQLAlchemy session ensures that the simultaneous database operations don't leave the database tables in an inconsistent state. 

7) In your assignment3, suppose we wanted to support update operation on adminresource.
   It should be possible to update the password of the admin, but not name.
   Write the code for this method. Show the REST endpoint, HTTP method.
   What error checks will you include in your implementation?
