Wow that is quite random
Super random stuff like there are 7 continents on earth
Yo
As an IB analyst, analyzing revenue models involves dissecting how a company generates income and assessing its sustainability and scalability. Subscription-based models, prevalent in software, media, and telecom sectors, offer predictable revenue streams, bolstered by recurring fees from subscribers. Evaluating metrics such as subscriber churn rates, customer acquisition costs, and lifetime value is critical to gauge the model's effectiveness. Conversely, transactional models, common in e-commerce and retail, rely on individual purchases, necessitating a focus on metrics like average order value, conversion rates, and customer acquisition costs. Hybrid models combining elements of subscriptions and transactions are also emerging, offering flexibility and diverse revenue streams. Understanding the nuances of these models enables IB analysts to provide comprehensive insights into a company's revenue generation potential and its implications for valuation and investment strategies.
That is a great question, Shaz. Indeed, you could calculate a revised revenue model like that.

Wow this is super interesting 
Connor, here are my notes for computer architecture:
16 bit address space (2^16 locations)
byte addressible (each location holds 1 byte)
granularity of 2 bytes

is it performing well? execution time look at
execution time = # of instructions * CPI * clock period === # of instructions * (time per instruction)
	- # of instructions
		- depends on ISA and compiler (LC3b has 14 instructions)
	- CPI: cycles per instruction
		- depends on uarch, key thing a microarchitect tries to reduce
		- IPC is inverse
	- clock period: inverse of clock frequency
		- depends on uarch and physical implementation
		- critical path determines the period

variable length instruction pros:
	extend ISA as needed, more compact code, denser instruction stream
fixed length instruction pros:
	easier to compile, more efficient for decoder design


when cycle time gets better, CPI gets worse
	- higher freq, lower cycle time -&gt; less work per cycle
	- therefore each instruction takes more cycles to complete same work
Hey Connor, for reference, the way you determine the efficiency of a processor is with execution time. Execution time is calculated by doing (# of instructions) * CPI * clock period
